# EZ-Symlink
This Python GUI tool "EZ-Symlink" helps create symbolic links between files in source &amp; target directories, simplifying file organization.



Symbolic Link Creator
Description
The "Symbolic Link Creator" is a Python script that provides a user-friendly Graphical User Interface (GUI) to create symbolic links between files in a source directory and a target directory. Symbolic links are references to files or directories that point to the original location on the file system.

How to Use
Run the script using Python.
The GUI window will appear with two input fields: "Source Directory" and "Target Directory."
Click the "Browse" buttons to select the source and target directories.
Once directories are selected, click the "Create Links" button to initiate symbolic link creation.
The script will process the directories, displaying messages for created links, warnings, or errors.
Requirements
Python 3.x
tkinter library (usually included in standard Python distribution)
Note
Ensure that the directories you choose are accessible and have appropriate permissions.
Symbolic links are created from the source to the target directory, so any changes to the linked file will affect both locations.
